        <p>Welcome to a little online code exhibition of the <em>Programmieren für Medienwissenschaftler*innen</em> seminar. It documents some of the explorations students did while independently exploring programming and software as a medium of cultural expression, and chose to share with you. We hope you enjoy the diversity!</p>

              "essay": `<p>//introduction<br>
'unicorn' is supposed to be a little game but i don't have the programming skills for that so far. so for now i integrated some lower level interactivity to have a visual sketch of how the game might look like in the future and used this one to explore functions, to write more organized code (you can see some older version if you scroll down), and to just mess around a bit with trashy designs.</p>
<p>//development<br>
the visual part of the game didn't develop that much during the process of programming. i focused more on developing the code a bit, working with functions and stuff.</p>
<p>//myInterests<br>
to me it seemed interesting to try something interactive as i didn't focus on that before. also i find it quite interesting to think about the interaction of technology/software and humans. i guess there is also interaction with programs i wouldn't think of as "interactive" straightaway but i wanted to foreground the interactivity a bit here.</p>

<p>//mediaPraxis<br>
my media praxis regarding computer software developed on various layers. i would say that software became vivid to me in a way. before i was thinking of software as technology, programming skills as qualification, and studying as a very linear process. instead i discovered a creative space and found myself reading, writing, watching, trying, exploring, leaving, learning, cherishing, returning, enjoying, retrying, understanding. also i was having a lot of fun - didn't expect that beforehand.</p>

<p>//future<br>
the end of this seminar feels more like the start of my curiosity. now as i've collected the different impressions from the topics we've been talking/thinking/etc. about and some basic programming skills, i'd love to explore in different directions. special interests atm: more complex movements in visualization (i guess there'll be some maths involved in this part), creating sound (i mean i love techno and how cool would it be to create some sounds/noises myself? - super cool!), maybe exploring possible relations between sounds and visuals, more complex interaction, and also thinking and reading about software and humans and society. e.g. how software reinforces social patterns, or technology and feminism. i think there are some interesting intersections to social sciences there. </p>`,

Each frame, the position of the linked circles is updated to wander along the edges. I got the idea when we talked about animation in class: would it be not interesting to move an object in dependence of another object's position? Then, I used what we learned about lists and loops to make a chain of those dependencies.</p>

<p>For me, it is hard to describe how my "media praxis" developed. Since I have always been a computer person, I felt like the seminar did advance my theoretical understanding. I had troubles finding connecting factors between my prior knowledge and the "textual work" of the media studies. This has become much easier for me.</p>`,

<p>This media praxis helped me to understand that you don't need fancy and expensive tools like photoshop for basic shape driven art. You can create abstract pieces or create posters, magazine covers with this. In the future if I am not subscribed to any of those programs, I would definitely use coding to create digital media. Because software is now becoming widely available because of open source coding I think people will be more inclined to create their own code for certain things. This reminds me of how people use to make their own radios. I think it is going to be like that. Maybe it is like that now but I was able to discover that through media praxis.</p> `,
